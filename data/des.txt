long.

One of the many Dungeon executioners, wielding a giant spiked flail that,
luckily, is good for little else besides its gruesome profession.

% watcher

Despite unusually acute senses that enable its ceaseless vigilance, not to
mention the fact that it has no need of sleep, this imp is universally despised
by its comrades. Some even hold that it is the work of an evil wizard, a
cross-breed between the ugliest of humans and goblins.

% warden

The Dungeon warden. It will call for help with its warning horn if it spots you.

% guard

A warrior clad in light armor, able to throw poisoned javelins with surprising
accuracy.

% sentinel

What a strange sentinel. The devs really need to redo this monster.

% lead_turtle

A monstrous contraption, no doubt the latest invention of the Laboratory
alchemists. Its heavy shell shines dully in the dim light.

% iron_wasp

A tiny buzzing insect, seemingly forged out of thin metal sheets. It's almost as
if its four wings are mounted on its back instead of its sides...

you're seeing this message, something has gone very wrong.)$.

in which the hill-goblins overran this stronghold. It sits here, nursing its
wounds and waiting miserably until its execution.

% crystal_statue

shimmering horribly. You wish you could smash it into pieces.

creating evil inventions. Somehow it doesn't care about you.

% hauler

A very ordinary Dungeon slave, doing very ordinary hauling work.

% engineer

ancient skeleton resurrected for that purpose.

% death_mage

A human mage, specializing in the manipulations of undead skeletons.

% skeletal_axemaster

for the purpose of testing the efficiency of war axes in battle. Battles are

miserable as possible. His features are perpetually twisted into a leer of cruel
contempt.

light.

being a wall in a little bit.

fire and lightning.
