- Add emits_heat to Mob{}, define Burning Brute
- Update tickTemperature() to work with material's specific heat
- Add min_heat, max_heat to Mob{}; add tickTemperatureEffects()

Ideas
=====
[+] planned, [~] obsolete, [x] done
~ Layers, as in Brogue? (gas, liquid, surface, floor, etc.)
+ Cloaks of invisibility, confusion, blinding, camouflage, electricity
  resistance, fire resistance, etc.
- Ring of seeing (magic mapping)
+ Rings have negative effects (decreased piety/willpower)
+ Add bonus (or neg bonus) to attacker if defender moved or didn't move in the
  past two turns
+ Ring of intimidation that magic maps dungeon based on mob's memory
+ Crafting grid/alchemy by arranging items on map and dancing
x Lighting system and torches
- Light colors
x Ring of echolocation to magic-map neighbors of sound-producing tiles
- "Night", when guards sleep, torches go out, and night creatures awaken
- "Seed database" that stores bones for players who died during game, then
  shows ingame bones/corpses/undead on other games
- Candles that destory people/objects/rooms when quenched
- "Permeability" instead of walkability, that lets creatures pass if they are
  small enough (e.g., rats and small spires could pass through iron bars)
- Tile "integrity" that reduces when tile is hit with explosion
- Radioactivity system: nuclear reactors, uranium, corium, nuclear bombs that
  the player can blow up for fun
- Orchestra/Concert, that sings/players instruments and distracts guards
	- Bonus: use Nazi singer names
- Goblin "organizations" (purely eye candy)
	- the Goblin Brotherhood, the ProudGobbos, the Seven Percenters, the
	  Goblin Nations, etc
- Night creatures should pop out of artwork at night
+ Stone guardians that patrol map and cast confusion at enemies, but move at 1
  tile per 10-20 turns
- Enemies that surrender or start whimpering when fleeing and trapped in a
  corner, or maybe perpare for one final all-out assault
- Enemies that suicide when cornered and about to die.
- Headstones with previous player's comments on them, or ghosts that mourn
  previous player's carelessnes (think DCSS ghosts)
	- Bonus: the ghosts/gravestones are found in the temple in prison cells
- Pub for guards to get drunk
- Ring to detect powered machines
- Ring/feature to detect what kind of mob made a noise
- Radioactive gas leaking from a warehouse on a few levels, so a kind of food
  clock
- Ability to rifle sleeping/drunk/stunned guards as well as corpses
- Lava flans
- Undead have other interesting kinds of negative effects when they score a
  hit?
	- Reduced max HP, less regen rate, reduced stealth
- Areas that speed up or slow down mobs
- Lichen/fungi that puts mobs to sleep (enchanted ground)
- Ice/oily floor that randomizes movement
- Ground in Temple should drain stats, max HP, cause fatigue, etc
- Sticky ground that reduces evasion
- Mobile traps that can be placed by player and used to lure guards on top
	- {Bombs/landmines, bear trap, damage trap} "kits"
- Statues can only move when out of sight, and then very fast.
- Item/lever player can trigger to unlock locked doors in room, releasing
  prisoners and creating maximum chaos.
+ Use Dijkstra for lighting/FOV?
- Potion and Ring ID system.
x Blood spattering?
- Speech bubbles in following situations:
  - On spotting an enemy ("Aha!", "It's a <species>!", "It's the @!!")
  - On being cornered ("Don't touch me!", "Go away!", "No farther!")
  - On seeing a dead ally, killed by a visible hostile ("Murderer!")
  - On pursuing a fleeing hostile ("Coward!", "Wimp!", "Bye clown!")
  - On investigating a noise ("...?", "What?", "Must have been rats!")
- Smell mechanics that allow, say, hellhounds and snakes to detect intruders
  even if they can't see them.
- Ranged melee weapons, e.g., spear and whips
x Add braziers that are built into the walls (aka torches), and use that
  instead for corridors
- Some kind of squad-forming fast-moving swarming mob, like killer bees (DCSS)
  or swarmers (Cogmind 7DRL)
+ Level with hospital (get healed with healing gas), nursery (kill baby goblins!),
  dining room, bedrooms, kitchen
+ "cameras kits" that create surface items that keep the surrounding area in the
  FOV of all mobs that have a certain ring on
- Experiment with "bouncing" rays in raycasting routines
- Ring/item that has leaving a vunerable "copy" of yourself where that item/ring
  was activated (that is, *two* tiles have the .mob field pointing to the player,
  while the player.coord field points to only one of them).

Optimizations
=============
- Use @mulAdd where possible (FOV, A*, Dijkstra, light/atmosphere/sound systems)
- Use @setCold(true) where possible (see above for places to look)
- Use SIMD where possible
x Use a matrix to mark nodes as closed (instead of a heap-allocated list) for
  Dijkstra.
- Use Manhattan distance for A* algorithm (overestimating heuristic might be better?)
- Allow functions that repeatedly call A* for the same mob to store an "AstarContext"
  structure that allows astar.path() to reuse cell cost, walkablility, etc data
  without calling those functions again.
- Use atan to calculate octant in which coord appears relative to mob's coord, instead
  of the slower method seen in Coord.closestDirectionTo()

Code cleanups
=============
- Defined unimplemented(), todo(), and oom()
- Stop using the freaking `catch unreachable` syntax:
    libera#zig 19:58 <ikskuh> "catch unreachable" will happily continue to execute code
                              after the error in non-safe build modes
- Remove all floats from color functions, sound systems, gas systems, etc.
- Review usage of usize and change to u64/u32 where needed to prevent portability issues
- Define custom assert() that can give additional context

Refactorings
============
- Define Species struct and carry immutable data for each mob in it
x Convert enum+union pair to union(enum) (see std/fifo.zig) where needed
x Research Manhattan distance vs Euclidian distance vs Moore neighborhood:
  https://reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/nev1jg/a_pathfinding_unstablenondeterministic/
x Add power component to machines
x Use Chebyshev or Moore Neighborhood instead of Manhattan distance
- Use arrays and indexes for state.* instead of linked lists and pointers

Tests
=====
x Ensure that distance() treats diagonal moves as more expensive than cardinal moves, or
  the opposite if Chebyshev/Moore is used later.
