  mob has low willpower.

  hundred turns to reach their full potential.

  silver, and iron).

	  out, resulting in death squads being sent to the appropriate level.
announcement system
	- Player can operate this to get a popup detailing stuff about the dungeon.

	- Should only appear in the Research branch.

vending machine
	- Alternative to food stockpile...?
fire alarm
	- Registers a FireAlarm when heat increases around it, drawing mobs
	  designated as FireFighter towards it to remove the fire (if any --

Refactorings/Fixes/Optimizations
--------------------------------
Use @mulAdd where possible (FOV, A*, Dijkstra, light/atmosphere/sound systems)
Use @setCold(true) where possible (see above for places to look)
Use SIMD where possible
Defined unimplemented() and todo()
Stop using the freaking `catch unreachable` syntax:
	libera#zig 19:58 <ikskuh> "catch unreachable" will happily continue to execute code
	                          after the error in non-safe build modes
Research Manhattan distance vs Euclidian distance vs Moore neighborhood
	https://reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/nev1jg/a_pathfinding_unstablenondeterministic/
Define Species struct and carry immutable data for each mob in it
Convert enum+union pair to union(enum) (see std/fifo.zig) where needed


Roadmap
-------
x Basic prefabs
x Allow for definition of a 'start' prefab
x Allow for placement of player in a location
- Allow for prefabs to be restricted to a map
- Allow for placement of specific item in a location
- Add exit staircase that exits game
- Add screen/confirmation for winning
- Add screen/confirmation for death
- Add very simple morgue files
- Add potion struct, define some potions
- Throw some potions around during mapgen
- Allow picking up of potions
- Add dialog to view inventory
- Add dialog to use item in inventory (quaff potions)
- Add dialog to throw potion at mob
- Define where rings should be in prefabs
