Machines
--------
furnace
	- Heats air on one side of the chamber. May or may not be used by mobs.
	- If used by mobs: maybe to run an execution/torture chamber...?
	- If used by player: used to kill mobs in a vault?
cooler
	- Cools the surrounding air, helping to preserve e.g. food items.
forge
	- Stuff some metal on one end, and weapons will appear on the other.
book copy machine
	- Makes a book two.
memory condenser
	- "Condenses" player's memory into a (map) book.
food ration maker
	- Stuff corpses, fungi, and lichen (I know, gross) next to it and rations
	  will appear on the other side.
camera
	- Pressure plate thing that puts an alert out if a non-Sauron-aligned
	  mob walks on it. (Alerts result in death squads sent out.)
alarm system
	- ???
announcement system
	- ???
teleportation station
	- Player can use it to teleport to a certain location.
uranium refinery
	- Should only appear in the Research branch.

	  of corium.
potion synthesis machine
	- Should be a synthesis machine for each major potion.
	- Should only appear in the Research branch.
power station
	- Orc-powered power station.
nuclear reactor
	- Recharges power storage machines. When destroyed, releases massive
	  quantities of radioactive gases, noxious fumes, boiling uranium,
	  and lots of other nasty stuff, as well as a tremendous explosion.
heat-powered power station
	- If put in a hot place (ie next to lava), will self-power.
railgun
	- Should appear in the Research branch of the dungeon.
	- Unused by mobs, and mostly useless for player.
	- Zaps everything in a line, and self-destructs after X shots.
repair shop
	- Mobs and player may use it to repair weapons and armor.
air purifier
	- Clears away gases in a certain radius.
power storage
	- Powers all machines in a certain radius, until it itself runs out of
	  power. Useful for extending power station's range.
	- Player can destroy it to release electricity, zapping everything
	  (including player) in a certain radius.
elevator
	- Spawns mobs for death squads, or mobs when the number of laborers/guards
	  falls below a certain point
sonar mining laser
	- Unused by mobs, player can use it to blast away everything in a certain
	  radius, in a certain direction.

Refactorings
------------
"Time energy" system for ticks/turns
Stop using the freaking `catch unreachable` syntax:
	19:58 <ikskuh> "catch unreachable" will happily continue to execute code after the error in non-safe build modes
Research Manhattan distance vs Euclidian distance vs Moore neighborhood
	https://old.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/nev1jg/a_pathfinding_unstablenondeterministic/
Define Species struct and carry immutable data for each mob in it
Convert enum+union pair to union(enum) (see std/fifo.zig)
