~ Layers, as in Brogue? (gas, liquid, surface, floor, etc.)
- Cloaks of invisibility, confusion, blinding, camouflage, electricity
  resistance, fire resistance, etc.

  small enough (e.g., rats and small spires could pass through iron bars)
- Tile "integrity" that reduces when tile is hit with explosion
- Radioactivity system: nuclear reactors, uranium, corium, nuclear bombs that
  the player can blow up for fun
- Orchestra/Concert, that sings/players instruments and distracts guards
	- Bonus: use Nazi singer names

  hit?
	- Reduced max HP, less regen rate, reduced stealth
- Areas that speed up or slow down mobs
- Lichen/fungi that puts mobs to sleep (enchanted ground)
- Ice/oily floor that randomizes movement

- Speech bubbles in following situations:
  - On spotting an enemy ("Aha!", "It's a <species>!", "It's the @!!")
  - On being cornered ("Don't touch me!", "Go away!", "No farther!")
  - On seeing a dead ally, killed by a visible hostile ("Murderer!")
  - On seeing a dead ally, killed by a nonvisible hostile ("Oh no!", "Noo!")
  - On pursuing a fleeing hostile ("Coward!", "Wimp!", "Bye clown!")
  - On investigating a noise ("...?", "What?")
  - On completing investigation of a noise ("Must have been rats!")
  - On finding an pursued enemy ("Its here!", "I've got you now!", "Now you're mine!")
- Smell mechanics that allow, say, hellhounds and snakes to detect intruders
  even if they can't see them.
- Ranged melee weapons, e.g., spear and whips
x Add braziers that are built into the walls (aka torches), and use that
  instead for corridors
- Some kind of squad-forming fast-moving swarming mob, like killer bees (DCSS)
  or swarmers (Cogmind 7DRL)
- Level with hospital (get healed with healing gas), nursery (kill baby goblins!),
  dining room, bedrooms, kitchen
- "cameras kits" that create surface items that keep the surrounding area in the
  FOV of all mobs that have a certain ring on
- Experiment with "bouncing" rays in raycasting routines
- Ring/item that has leaving a vunerable "copy" of yourself where that item/ring
  was activated (that is, *two* tiles have the .mob field pointing to the player,
  while the player.coord field points to only one of them).
- weapon runes:
	- interleaving
		- Swap on hit
	- banishing
		- Teleports away

Optimizations
=============
- Use @mulAdd where possible (FOV, A*, Dijkstra, light/atmosphere/sound systems)
- Use @setCold(true) where possible (see above for places to look)
- Use SIMD where possible
x Use a matrix to mark nodes as closed (instead of a heap-allocated list) for
  Dijkstra.
x Use Manhattan distance for A* algorithm (overestimating heuristic might be better?)
- Allow functions that repeatedly call A* for the same mob to store an "AstarContext"
  structure that allows astar.path() to reuse cell cost, walkablility, etc data
  without calling those functions again.
- Use atan to calculate octant in which coord appears relative to mob's coord, instead
  of the slower method seen in Coord.closestDirectionTo()

Code cleanups
=============
- Defined unimplemented(), todo(), and oom()
- Stop using the `catch unreachable` syntax:
    libera#zig 19:58 <ikskuh> "catch unreachable" will happily continue to execute code
                              after the error in non-safe build modes
- Remove all floats from color functions, sound systems, gas systems, etc.
- Review usage of usize and change to u64/u32 where needed to prevent portability issues
- Define custom assert() that can give additional context
- Define Lua API and move the following to Lua data files:
  - levelFeature definitions (see mapgen.zig)
  - levelConfig (see mapgen.zig)
- Cleanup/factorize container/item manipulation code for Machine AI.

Refactorings
============
- Define Species struct and carry immutable data for each mob in it
x Convert enum+union pair to union(enum) (see std/fifo.zig) where needed
x Research Manhattan distance vs Euclidian distance vs Moore neighborhood:
  https://reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/nev1jg/a_pathfinding_unstablenondeterministic/
x Add power component to machines
x Use Chebyshev instead of Manhattan distance
- Use arrays and indexes for state.* instead of linked lists and pointers
- Use linked list for roomslist, and use raw pointers instead of indexes
  whenever needed in mapgen code.
- Keep track of each connected room in mapgen, so that no room connects to the
  same room twice.

Tests
=====
x Ensure that distance() treats diagonal moves as more expensive than cardinal moves, or
  the opposite if Chebyshev is used later.
