    for 2 turns. 4 charges.
  - "cannon kit" (CAV): creates permanent cannon on use (see below). 1 charge.
  - "lightning rod" (LAB): severely damages all mobs without rElec in FOV.
    - Note: implement electricity damage propagation for this.
  - "symbol of torment" (House): Gives .Fear to all mobs in FOV, and halves HP of
    all mobs (including evoker). Has no effect on rTorm or undead. ∞ charges.

    enough), and will blind and daze that monster. 4 charges.
  - room reader (TODO: name) (LAB): Can be evoked on an opaque tile that's
    adjacent to the player, such as a door, and it will show player what's
    behind it as if player was standing there. 6 charges.
    - Inspired by that article demonstrating ability to roughly determine
      what's in a room by shining a laser through a keyhole and analysing how
      the light beams bounced around inside.

    4 charges, pwr-station powered.
  x recharging stations: 4 charges. 1-2 per level.

  - summon stone: Summons a random (1-3) number of guards on the level to come
    to the command stone's location. 1 charge.

Ideas
=====
[+] planned, [~] obsolete, [x] done
~ Layers, as in Brogue? (gas, liquid, surface, floor, etc.)
+ Cloaks of invisibility, confusion, blinding, camouflage, electricity
  resistance, fire resistance, etc.
  - cloak of shimmering: chance of daze mob that spots player?
- Ring of seeing (magic mapping)
~ Rings have negative effects (decreased piety/willpower)
  - obsolete: rings are expected to be worn at all times, not an item that can
    be swapped off or on depending on situation
~ Add bonus (or neg bonus) to attacker if defender moved or didn't move in the
  past two turns
  - obsolete: this game isn't cogmind. besides, too many obscure combat bonuses
    is bad.
~ Ring of intimidation that magic maps dungeon based on mob's memory
  - obsolete: mobs don't have memory. also, how would the UI tell what was mapped
    from another mob's memory vs what the player visited (maybe take a cue from
    cogmind and show such portions in greenscale/grayscale/bluescale?)
~ Crafting grid/alchemy by arranging items on map and dancing
  - obsolete: too complex
x Lighting system and torches
~ Light colors
  - obsolete: would complicate ui too much. "Is that floor color change from a
    light color, gas, or something else?"
x Ring of echolocation to magic-map neighbors of sound-producing tiles
- "Night", when guards sleep, torches go out, and night creatures awaken
- "Ghost database" that stores bones for players who died during game, then
  shows ingame bones/corpses/undead on other games
- Candles that destory people/objects/rooms when quenched
- "Permeability" instead of walkability, that lets creatures pass if they are
  small enough (e.g., rats and small spiders could pass through iron bars)
~ Tile "integrity" that reduces when tile is hit with explosion
  - obsolete: too complex
~ Radioactivity system: nuclear reactors, uranium, corium, nuclear bombs that
  the player can blow up for fun
  - obsolete: too complex
~ Orchestra/Concert, that sings/players instruments and distracts guards
  - obsolete: making all the guards move to one corner of the map suddenly is
    obviously going to make things easier for player /s
- Goblin "organizations" (purely eye candy)
  - the Goblin Brotherhood, the ProudGobbos, the Seven Percenters, the
    Goblin Nations, etc
- Night creatures should pop out of artwork at night
~ Stone guardians that patrol map and cast confusion at enemies, but move at 1
  tile per 10-20 turns
  - obsolete: that's abominations now
- Headstones with previous player's comments on them, or ghosts that mourn
  previous player's carelessnes (think DCSS ghosts)
  - Bonus: the ghosts/gravestones are found in the temple in prison cells
~ Pub for guards to get drunk
  - obsolete: how would this affect gameplay? (maybe just a vault would be fine?)
- Ring to detect powered machines
- Ring/feature to detect what kind of mob made a noise
- Radioactive gas leaking from a warehouse on a few levels, so a kind of food
  clock
- Ability to rifle sleeping/drunk/stunned guards as well as corpses
- Undead have other interesting kinds of negative effects when they score a
  hit?
  - Reduced max HP, less regen rate, reduced stealth
- Areas that speed up or slow down mobs
- Lichen/fungi that puts mobs to sleep (enchanted ground)
- Ice/oily floor that randomizes movement
- Sticky ground that reduces evasion
x Mobile traps that can be placed by player and used to lure guards on top
  x {Bombs/landmines, bear trap, damage trap} "kits"
x Item/lever player can trigger to unlock locked doors in room, releasing
  prisoners and creating maximum chaos.
~ Use Dijkstra for lighting/FOV?
~ Potion and Ring ID system.
  - obsolete: too complex
x Blood spattering?
x Speech bubbles in following situations: (removed)
- Smell mechanics that allow, say, hellhounds and snakes to detect intruders
  even if they can't see them.
x Ranged melee weapons, e.g., spear and whips
x Add braziers that are built into the walls (aka torches), and use that
  instead for corridors
- Some kind of squad-forming fast-moving swarming mob, like killer bees (DCSS)
  or swarmers (Cogmind 7DRL)
- "cameras kits" that create surface items that keep the surrounding area in the
  FOV of all mobs that have a certain ring on
~ Experiment with "bouncing" rays in raycasting routines
~ Ring/item that has leaving a vunerable "copy" of yourself where that item/ring
  was activated (that is, *two* tiles have the .mob field pointing to the player,
  while the player.coord field points to only one of them).
  - obsolete: could lead to subtle bugs
- weapon runes:
  - interleaving: Swap on hit
  - banishing:    Teleports away
x MP-like system that limits how often spellcasters can cast spells (providing
  a way to tweak dangerous-ness) and how often player can use ring effects.
- Extremely dangerous (but lucrative) vaults that have golden walls, warning
  player of danger.
- Nice floor tile patterns, like Ultima Ratio Regum.

- Bribing: bribe lone monsters to stay quiet, but they'll turn hostile again if
  an unbribed comrade shows up
  - Gold + jewelry collection
  - Bri(b)ing key to bribe lone monsters
- "Doormat" poster that has welcoming messages on it, right next to stairs
  - Maybe describes level's challenges for new players?
+ Put actual loot in chests + plus new TGGW-like interace for containers

Optimizations
=============
- Use @mulAdd where possible (FOV, A*, Dijkstra, light/atmosphere/sound systems)
- Use @setCold(true) where possible (see above for places to look)
- Use SIMD where possible
x Use a matrix to mark nodes as closed (instead of a heap-allocated list) for
  Dijkstra.
x Use Manhattan distance for A* algorithm (overestimating heuristic might be better?)
- Allow functions that repeatedly call A* for the same mob to store an "AstarContext"
  structure that allows astar.path() to reuse cell cost, walkablility, etc data
  without calling those functions again.
- Use atan to calculate octant in which coord appears relative to mob's coord, instead
  of the slower method seen in Coord.closestDirectionTo()

Code cleanups
=============
x Defined unimplemented(), todo(), and oom()
x Stop using the `catch unreachable` syntax:
    libera#zig 19:58 <ikskuh> "catch unreachable" will happily continue to execute code
                              after the error in non-safe build modes
- Remove all floats from color functions, sound systems, gas systems, etc.
- Review usage of usize and change to u64/u32 where needed to prevent portability issues
- Define custom assert() that can give additional context
- Define Lua API and move the following to Lua data files:
  - levelFeature definitions (see mapgen.zig)
  - levelConfig (see mapgen.zig)
- Cleanup/factorize container/item manipulation code for Machine AI.

Refactorings
============
x Define Species struct and carry immutable data for each mob in it
x Convert enum+union pair to union(enum) (see std/fifo.zig) where needed
x Research Manhattan distance vs Euclidian distance vs Moore neighborhood:
  https://reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/nev1jg/a_pathfinding_unstablenondeterministic/
x Add power component to machines
x Use Chebyshev instead of Manhattan distance
- Use arrays and indexes for state.* instead of linked lists and pointers
- Use linked list for roomslist, and use raw pointers instead of indexes
  whenever needed in mapgen code.
x Keep track of each connected room in mapgen, so that no room connects to the
  same room twice.

Tests
=====
x Ensure that distance() treats diagonal moves as more expensive than cardinal moves, or
  the opposite if Chebyshev is used later.
