# Treasure vaults

Inspired by TGGW's Golden and Stone Rooms, treasure vaults in Oathbreaker
provide the potential of high-value loot, with the downside of being forced to
fight all manner of deadly OOD-monsters. Before opening the vault's doors (which
will be invariably closed), you'll have to decide whether the possibility of
finding yourself in melee range with extremely dangerous enemies is worth the
chance of getting some great equipment. It's unlikely you'll accidentally enter
one, however, as treasure vaults always generate with distinct walls, and the
game will warn you before you enter one. **If in doubt, don't open them.** They
are completely optional.

**Vault generation**:
- More than one vault cannot generate on a floor.
- Many, but not all, floors will have one vault.
- Treasure vaults can generate on the lowest floors, but opening one so soon is
  almost certainly suicidal.

There is currently just one kind of treasure vault. More kinds will be
implemented in the future.

**Strategies** for raiding a vault:
- Be prepared for some deadly ranged attacks from spires or spellcasters.
- Ensure you can use AoE consumables (!paralyse, !confuse, !poison) if needed.
- Once again, remember that you *do not* have to kill every monster inside.
  - Throwing a !paralysation, grabbing whatever loot you want, and running away
    is a perfectly viable strategy. (*Just be prepared for unbreathing monsters
    that won't be affected by gases!*)

## Iron Vaults

- Rusty walls.
- Recruits, defenders, javelineers, death knights, bone mages, iron and
  lightning spires.
- Rare chance of necromancers, war olgs, or warriors.
- Currently found throughout the Dungeon. (This will change in the future as
  more vaults are added.)
