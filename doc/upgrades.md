# Upgrades

Upgrades, loosely inspired by Boohu's aptitudes system, are various permanent
benefits awarded thrice to the player in a game. There are currently 11
aptitudes, but only 3 of them can be received in any game.

## Fast

> "You feel yourself moving faster.",

You move 10% faster (you'll receive a free move every 10 turns). Probably the
weakest of all upgrades.

## Strong

> "You feel mighty!",

You are 50% stronger. As your base player's strength is 20, your new strength
will be 30, thus receiving a 15% damage bonus instead of 10%.

## Agile

> "You are good at evading blows.",

You have a +20% bonus to your base dexterity.

## OI_Enraged

> "You feel hatred building up inside.",

You will get the `enraged` status when critically injured (i.e., when an attack
takes 50% of your HP off, or an attack leaves you at below 10% HP).

## OI_Fast

> "You put on a burst of speed when injured.",

You will get the `fast` status when critically injured (i.e., when an attack
takes 50% of your HP off, or an attack leaves you at below 10% HP).

## OI_Shove

> "You begin shoving past foes when injured.",

You will get the `shove` status when critically injured (i.e., when an attack
takes 50% of your HP off, or an attack leaves you at below 10% HP).

## Healthy

> "You are unusually robust.",

You have 50% more health than usual. You will usually need an extra pip of
rHubris if you receive this upgrade.

## Mana

> "You sense your inner strength grow.",

You have 50% more mana than usual.

## Stealthy

> "You move stealthily.",

You have one intrinsic pip of stealth.

## Will

> "Your will hardens.",

Your will is three pips higher than usual.

## Echolocation

> "Your sense of hearing becomes acute.",

You passively map an area around sounds you can hear.
