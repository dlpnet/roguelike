# Upgrades

Upgrades, loosely inspired by Boohu's aptitudes system, are various permanent
benefits awarded thrice to the player in a game. There are currently 6
aptitudes, but only 3 of them can be received in any game.

## Agile

> "You are good at evading blows."

You have a +10% bonus to your evade%.

## OI_Enraged

> "You feel hatred building up inside."

You will get the `enraged` status when critically injured (i.e., when an attack
takes 50% of your HP off, or an attack leaves you at below 10% HP).

## OI_Shove

> "You begin shoving past foes when injured."

You will get the `shove` status when critically injured (i.e., when an attack
takes 50% of your HP off, or an attack leaves you at below 10% HP).

## Healthy

> "You are unusually robust."

You have 50% more health than usual. You will usually need an extra pip of
rHubris if you receive this upgrade.

## Will

> "Your will hardens."

Your will is three pips higher than usual.

## Echolocation

> "Your sense of hearing becomes acute."

You passively map an area around sounds you can hear.
