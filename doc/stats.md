## Evade%

Your evade% is your chance to dodge.  So e.g., a mob with a evade% of 30 will
have a 30% chance to dodge, and a mob with 10 evade% will have a 10% chance to
dodge.

### Combat

Damage dealt in melee receives a (Strength / 2)% bonus. Examples:

| Strength | Bonus |
|:--------:|:-----:|
| 10       |  5%   |
| 20       | 10%   |
| 40       | 20%   |
| 50       | 25%   |

### Unjamming

The mob's strength determines the chance each turn for the jammed machine to
become unjammed; a mob with 10 strength has a 10% chance, and a mob with 50
strength has a 50% chance.

The strength also determines the chance for the unjammed machine to break. A
mob with 50 strength has 50% chance of breaking the machine; a mob with 10
strength has a 10% chance of breaking it, etc.
