# Strength

Strength affects a number of areas, specifically combat and unjamming. A mob's
strength is always in the range 0-50.

## Unjamming

The mob's strength determines the chance each turn for the jammed machine to
become unjammed; a mob with 10 strength has a 10% chance, and a mob with 50
strength has a 50% chance.

The strength also determines the chance for the unjammed machine to break. A
mob with 50 strength has 50% chance of breaking the machine; a mob with 10
strength has a 10% chance of breaking it, etc.
