## Smithing

Smithing/3 contains the Iron Rune.

- Open terrain makes it a bit more difficult to run.
- Steam vents, smoke clouds, and noxious fumes make hanging around in certain
  areas dangerous.
- Fuming fiends are a Smithing-only speciality.
- Smoke clouds and large splotches of fungi obscure vision...
- ...Until fuming fiends dispel clouds, and fungi is set on fire.

## Prison

- The starting area.
- Drains that are unique to the Prison allow teleporting across level.
- Executioners wander a single room, making it difficult to stab. They carry
  a giant knout capable of two-shotting you, but attack slowly.
- Later levels may contain the occasional Abomination.

## Laboratory

Laboratory/3 contains the Learned Rune.

- More sentinels than usual. Sentinels are watcher-like guards that shoot nets
  at you before moving in to stab with a knife.
- Air purifiers scattered in a few rooms make potions harder to use.
- Automatic-opening doors make it harder to break FOV of a pursuing monster.
- The so-called Experiments wander around rooms in the manner of an executioner;
  there are multiple kinds of experiments, each with their own unique bufs
  that make it more difficult to get rid of.
- There are much more Abominations here than in other branches.
- Spires make fighting in certain rooms extremely dangerous. Most of them will
  not attack unless an ally is present. However, you can set up your own spire
  with a spire kit, which are only found in the Laboratory and Smithing.

## Vaults

Vaults/3 contains the Hidden Rune.

- Home of the Wardens, slow-moving guards that sound the alarm at the sight
  of you, pulling in a ton more guards to investigate.
- Layout is very regular.
- Many rooms are completely lit, but many rooms are completely dark as well.
- No fungi to hide in, unfortunately. But no abominations either.
- More loot than usual.

## Morgue

(Unimplemented)

Morgue/3 contains the Ancient Rune.

- All manner of deaf and dumb undead.
- Occasional packs of skeletal warriors led by death mages, who can see and
  hear.
- Many more necromancers and demons than usual.
- Morgue/3 may contain the Symbol of Torment.

## Solitary

(Unimplemented)

40% chance to appear in any game.
Solitary/3 contains the Lonely Rune.

## Watchtower

(Unimplemented)

40% chance to appear in any game.
Watchtower/3 contains the Watchful Rune.
