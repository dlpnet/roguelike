Each branch has its own challenges and unique terrain and/or monsters.

There are currently four branches:
- Smithing
- Prison
- Laboratory
- Vaults

# Smithing

- Open terrain makes it a bit more difficult to run.
- Steam vents, smoke clouds, and noxious fumes make hanging around in certain
  areas dangerous.
- Smoke clouds and large splotches of fungi obscure vision.

# Prison

- The starting area.
- Drains that are unique to the Prison allow teleporting across level.
- Executioners wander a single room, making it difficult to stab. They carry
  a giant knout capable of two-shotting you, but attack slowly.
- Later levels may contain the occasional Abomination.

# Laboratory

- More sentinels than usual. Sentinels are watcher-like guards that shoot nets
  at you before moving in to stab with a knife.
- Air purifiers scattered in a few rooms make potions harder to use.
- Automatic-opening doors make it harder to break FOV of a pursuing monster.
- The so-called Experiments wander around rooms in the manner of an executioner;
  there are multiple kinds of experiments, each with their own unique bufs
  that make it more difficult to get rid of.
- There are much more Abominations here than in other branches.

# Vaults

- Home of the Wardens, slow-moving guards that sound the alarm at the sight
  of you, pulling in a ton more guards to investigate.
- Layout is very regular.
- Many rooms are completely lit, but many rooms are completely dark as well.
- No fungi to hide in, unfortunately. But no abominations either.
- More loot than usual.
