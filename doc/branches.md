## Caverns

Caverns/3 contains the Basalt Rune.

- Open terrain makes it a bit more difficult to run.
- Steam vents, smoke clouds, and noxious fumes make hanging around in certain
  areas dangerous.
- Vapour fiends, vapour mages, convults, and their dustling friends are a
  Caverns-only speciality.
- Smoke clouds and large splotches of fungi obscure vision...
- ...Until fuming fiends dispel clouds, and fungi is set on fire.

## Prison

- The starting area.
- Drains (unique to the Prison) allow teleporting across level.
- Executioners wander a single room, making it difficult to stab. They carry
  a giant knout capable of two-shotting you, but attack slowly.

## Laboratory

Laboratory/3 contains the Twisted Rune.

- More sentinels than usual. Sentinels are watcher-like guards that shoot nets
  at you before moving in to stab with a knife.
- Air purifiers scattered in a few rooms make potions harder to use.
- Automatic-opening doors make it harder to break FOV of a pursuing monster.
- Lead turtles and copper wasps are a Laboratory-only speciality.

## Quarters

Quarters/3 contains the Golden Rune.

- Home of the Wardens, slow-moving guards that sound the alarm at the sight
  of you, pulling in a ton more guards to investigate.
- Layout is very regular.
- Many rooms are completely lit, but many rooms are completely dark as well.

## Morgue

(Unimplemented)

Morgue/3 contains the Ancient Rune.

- All manner of deaf and dumb undead.
- Occasional packs of skeletal warriors led by death mages, who can see and
  hear.
- Many more necromancers and demons than usual.
- Morgue/3 may contain the Symbol of Torment.

## Solitary

Solitary/3 contains the Lonely Rune.

## Watchtower

(Unimplemented)

40% chance to appear in any game.
