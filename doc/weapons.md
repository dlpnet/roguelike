# Weapons

Each weapon in Oathbreaker is designed to have several distinct characteristics,
both downsides and upsides.

## Weapon Egos

Weapons may come with an "ego" which adds a special characteristic, mostly good:

- **Silver** weapons deal +20% electric damage, but only when they're within the
  aura of a battery pack.
- **Masterpiece** weapons are 60% faster than usual.
- **Bone** weapons deal 10% *less* damage to undead, but 30% *more* damage to
  the living. It also reduces your willpower by two pips.

All these weapon egos are exceedingly rare, but can be found more commonly in
certain areas:
- Silver weapons are found in the Laboratory, as well as guards who wield them.
  Battery packs are also more common in the Laboratory, but are found elsewhere
  as well.
- Masterpiece weapons are a bit more common in Smithing.
- Bone weapons are the rarest, but are (relatively) very common in the Morgue,
  exactly where they're most useless.
