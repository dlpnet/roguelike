# Weapons

Each weapon in Oathbreaker is designed to have several distinct characteristics,
both downsides and upsides.

## Weapon Egos

Weapons may come with an "ego" which adds a special characteristic, mostly good:

- **Copper** weapons deal +50% electric damage, but only when they're within the
  aura of a battery pack. Otherwise they deal up to -50% normal damage.
- **Masterpiece** weapons are 20% faster than usual and give a +10% melee bonus.
- **Bone** weapons deal 1 *less* damage to undead, but 1 *more* damage to
  the living (as long as they're not corrupted).
