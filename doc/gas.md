# Gases

**NOTE**: Current, the `eXamine` mode doesn't show what gas is on a tile. You'll
have to figure it out yourself for now (by the color), unfortunately.

Oathbreaker's gases are modelled after Brogue's being clouds that spread over
the surrounding area, usually at a rate of ~1 tile per turn. They can be created
by lava (smoke), harmful potions, and many other sources.
