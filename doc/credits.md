# Influences and credits

Oathbreaker draws ideas and inspiration from a wide selection of roguelikes:
- Upgrades are inspired by Boohu's aptitudes.
- The resistances system was stolen from TGGW.
- Simplified inventory management, with only one armor/weapon/cloak at a time,
  is from Boohu and Harmonist.
- The one-item-per-tile idea was taken from Cogmind.
- Windows is inspired by Harmonist.
- Lack of regeneration comes from TGGW and Boohu.
- Drains are inspired by Harmonist's barrel stones.
- Terrain-based positioning (with fungi, metal and wood floors, etc) was an
  original idea, but was influenced by Boohu and (in the case of fluorescent
  fungi) Brogue and TGGW.
- Positioning-based confusion effects was inspired by Boohu.
- Many monsters and their abilities were inspired by DCSS, such as ether
  fiends (servant of whispers), ancient magi (liches), wardens (vault sentinels),
  dustlings (saltlings), death magi (death knights... sort of),
  bone magi (moths of wrath), etc.
- Gas traps (and gases in general) were taken from Brogue.
- The UI layout was also inspired by Brogue, as is a single `a`pply key to use
  potions and other consumables.
- The Watchtower branch idea originated while the author was skimming the Golden
  Krone Hotel wiki. Of course, since the author hasn't actually played Golden
  Krone Hotel, it will differ widely from the branch in that game.
- Iron spike evocables were taken directly from TGGW.
- Explosions and destructible terrain in general is inspired by Cogmind.
- The lighting system was inspired by Golden Krone Hotel 7DRL.
- And of course, monster cone-shaped LOS and pattern-based abilities was stolen
  directly from Ironwood.

The following resources were also immensely useful while developing Oathbreaker:
- Many mechanics in Nethack were good case studies of what constitutes bad
  roguelike design.
- The prefab system was taken from Golden Krone Hotel's dev blog.
- The place-random-rooms map generation algorithm, used for Prison and
  Laboratory, was taken from
  [here](http://roguelikedeveloper.blogspot.com/2007/11/unangband-dungeon-generation-part-five.htm)
- r/roguelikedev's FAQ Friday and Sharing Saturday events were immensely
  helpful.
- GridSageGames' dev blog was a valuable resource as well on game design and
  balancing.
