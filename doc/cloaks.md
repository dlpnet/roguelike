# Cloaks

Cloaks are auxiliary armor that come with four egos:

- Cloak of fur (electricity resistance)
- Cloak of silicon (fire resistance)
- Cloak of velvet (stealthiness)
- Cloak of thorns (retaliatory attacks)

Like armor, you are expected to wear a cloak as soon as you find one. Unlike
armor, the only drawback to wearing a particular cloak is that you forfeit the
benefits given by wearing a cloak of another ego.

You should find at least two cloaks per game.

## Cloak of fur

A cloak of fur confers rElec+. See [resistances.md](resistances.md) for more

## Cloak of silicon

A cloak of silicon confers rFire+. See [resistances.md](resistances.md) for more
information.

## Cloak of velvet

A cloak of velvet confers Stealth+. See [stealth.md](stealth.md) for more
information.

## Cloak of thorns

A cloak of thorns gives a 14% chance to deal 7-14% damage on a missed melee
attack.
