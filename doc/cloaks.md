# Cloaks

Cloaks are auxiliary armor that come with four egos:

- Cloak of fur (electricity resistance)
- Cloak of silicon (fire resistance)
- Cloak of velvet (sneakiness)

Like armor, you are expected to wear a cloak as soon as you find one. Unlike
armor, the only drawback to wearing a particular cloak is that you forfeit the
benefits given by wearing a cloak of another ego. Each cloak should be equally
useful; the only reason you'd choose one over the other is because of a
different strategy or different item set.

## Cloak of fur

A cloak of fur confers rElec+. See [stats.md](stats.md) for more information.

## Cloak of silicon

A cloak of silicon confers rFire+. See [stats.md](stats.md) for more
information.

## Cloak of velvet

A cloak of velvet gives Sneak++, allowing you to move two more steps before
making noise.

## Cloak of thorns

A cloak of thorns grants you `+1 Spikes` stat. See [spikes.md](spikes.md) for
info on spiking and retaliation attacks.
